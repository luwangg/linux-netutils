# linux-netutils
A collection of small Linux networking utilities:
- nbr
- owd
- sit-ctl
- ssh-door
- udp-tun
- lte-rx
- gpgw

## nbr
### Non-blocking resolver.
It reads domain names from stdin and resolves bunches of them to IP
addresses in parallel.

## owd
### A tool to measure one-way network transmission delay.
It sends a probe packet to the remote host, which records its arrival
time and sends it back in the reply packet. To get meaningful results,
both local and remote hosts must keep accurate time synchronized with an
independent source.

## sit-ctl
### A tool to remotely change the endpoint of a sit tunnel interface.
If invoked as a server, it waits for the incoming requests and changes
the remote endpoint of the tracked sit interface to the source address
of the request packet. If invoked as a client, it sends such request to
the server.

## ssh-door
### A tool to allow SSH connections from a client who successively opened a secret URL.
The program adds client's source address to a list managed by xt_recent
iptables extension. To be able to do so, it must be set up as a setuid
root CGI application. Surely, its URL should require authentication, and
the transport should be HTTPS.

## udp-tun
### Forwards IPv4 or IPv6 over UDP with support for dynamic endpoints.
The program creates tunnel interfaces and connects them with UDPv4
packets. Addresses and routing have to be set up manually later. The
server keeps track of changes of the client address by simply using the
last address seen. The program provides no authentication, integrity
checks, or encryption, and therefore cannot withstand any deliberate
attack. It should be used in controlled environments only.

## lte-rx
### Prints LTE receive signal parameters.
This program queries a Huawei LTE USB modem (ME909 or similar), and
prints out signal strength statistics - RSSI, RSRP, SINR, and RSRQ - in
a human-readable form.

## gpgw
### A web interface to GPG decryption.
This is a WSGI application which asks for a name of an encrypted file
and for a passphrase, and then displays the decrypted contents of that
file.

## Usage
For any questions on command line options, constants, paths etc. refer
